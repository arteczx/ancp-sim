[burn_rate]
# Saint-Robert's Law: r = a * Pc^n
# a in mm/s/MPa^n
a = 3.5
# n is dimensionless
n = 0.5

[catalyst]
# Multiplier for the burn rate coefficient 'a' when a catalyst is present.
# e.g., a_catalyzed = a * multiplier
ferric_oxide_multiplier = 1.7

[efficiency]
# C* efficiency (0.0 to 1.0)
cstar_efficiency = 0.90
# Isp efficiency (0.0 to 1.0)
isp_efficiency = 0.92
